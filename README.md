# Todo.txt Manager with Raylib and Go

This experimental project explores the use of the Go binding for [Raylib](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) by developing a small graphical application to manage a `todo.txt` file based on the model by [Gina Trapani](https://todotxt.org/).  
It also uses the [todotxt](https://github.com/1set/todotxt) module for task manipulation.

---

## Objective

- Create a simple graphical interface to manage a `todo.txt` file.
- Test the integration of Raylib with Go in a practical project.
